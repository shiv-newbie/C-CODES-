/*
 Prime(N) â€“ Prime(N-1) = ?
 The sequence of n - 1 consecutive composite numbers (positive integers that are not prime and not equal to 1) lying between two successive prime numbers
 p and p + n is called a prime gap of length n. For example, (24, 25, 26, 27, 28) between 23 and 29 is a prime gap of length 6.
 
 Your mission is to write a program to calculate, for a given positive integer k, the length of the prime gap that contains k. For convenience, the
 length is considered 0 in case no prime gap contains k.
 
 Input
 The input is a sequence of lines each of which contains a single positive integer. Each positive integer is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the
 100000th prime number, which is 1299709. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.
 
 Output
 The output should be composed of lines each of which contains a single non-negative integer. It is the length of the prime gap that contains the
 corresponding positive integer in the input if it is a composite number or `0' otherwise. No other characters should occur in the output.
